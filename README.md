FRONTEND-PROJECTS

This repository contains all my frontend projects from the Elevvo Pathways internship. It includes work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, covering responsive designs, UI components, forms, animations, API integrations, and multi-page applications. These projects show my skills in building clean, user-friendly, and interactive web interfaces.
